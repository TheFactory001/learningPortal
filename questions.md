# Some exercises.

1. Create a table called “factoryUsers”, with columns, id, name, email, password, and country of residence.

Notes: 
id is autogenerated, basically generate random number of length 8 in Python then insert it into the database for each user.
Password must be well secured, I’m sure Daniel and Femi can remember the password validation task we did a while ago. 
(There are additional security steps like hashing and salting passwords but we can keep that for later).


2. Create a table called “factoryImages” with column, imageId, image, ownerId
Notes: This is an interesting one, basically we want to to store an image data into our database. 
The image cannot be saved using a file path so we need to be able convert the png or jpg into a format 
that the database will accept (BLOB). 

See the link below for some guidance. 


3. Create an HTML page with the following content
    - Text box for name
    - Text box for email
    - Text box for password 
    - Text box for country of residence 
    - A submit button.

Notes :
The styling is totally up to you.
Extra point if you can have a functioning JavaScript: This means when the summit button gets clicked, 
you can to log the contents of the text boxes. (Hint: use forms).


4. A flask backend server that we’ll connect the HTML code to the database code above. 
This can be local or deployed, if you’re going with deployed, please use AWS for consistency. 
Reach out to me for the AWS credentials if you need it.
