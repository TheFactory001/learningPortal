            Computational Math deals with the design of algorithms to perform
            mathematical calculations on a computer. The goal of computational
            mathematics, put simply, is to find or develop algorithms that solve
            mathematical problems computationally.

        <div class="defs">
          Machine learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that
          enables computers to “self-learn” from training data and improve over
          time, without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning algorithms
          are able to detect patterns in data and learn from them, in order to
          make their own predictions. In short, machine learning algorithms and
          models learn through experience.

          Cybersecurity is the protection of internet-connected systems such as
          hardware, software and data from cyberthreats. The practice is used by
          individuals and enterprises to protect against unauthorized access to
          data centers and other computerized systems.

          Data Analytics refers to the techniques used to analyze data to
          enhance productivity and business gain. Data is extracted from various
          sources and is cleaned and categorized to analyze various behavioral

          An embedded system is an electronic system that has a software and is
          embedded in computer hardware. It is programmable or nonprogrammable
          depending on the application. An embedded system is defined as a way
          of working, organizing, performing single or multiple tasks according
          to a set of rules.

          An introduction to computational fundamentals behind the design and
          control of autonomous robots. Robots are considered to be autonomous
          when they make decisions in response to their environment (rather than
          simply following a pre-programmed set of motions). They achieve this
          using a multitude of modern techniques ranging from signal processing,
          control theory, artificial intelligence, and more.
