    Using resources available to us, we will develop innovative systems and
    solutions. Our areas of focus include and is not limited to the following
    fields.
  </p>
  <section>
    <h3>COMPUTATIONAL MATHEMATICS</h3>
    <p>
      Computational Math deals with the design of algorithms to perform
      mathematical calculations on a computer. The goal of computational
      mathematics, put simply, is to find or develop algorithms that solve
      mathematical problems computationally.

    <h3>MACHINE LEARNING</h3>
    <p>
      Machine learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that
      enables computers to “self-learn” from training data and improve over
      time, without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning algorithms are
      able to detect patterns in data and learn from them, in order to make
      their own predictions. In short, machine learning algorithms and models
      learn through experience.

    <h3>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</h3>
    <p>
      Artificial Intelligence is the ability of a digital computer or
      computer-controlled robot to perform tasks commonly associated with
      intelligent beings.

    <h3>CYBER SECURITY</h3>
    <p>
      Cybersecurity is the protection of internet-connected systems such as
      hardware, software and data from cyberthreats. The practice is used by
      individuals and enterprises to protect against unauthorized access to data
      centers and other computerized systems.
    </p>

    <h3>DATA ANALYTICS</h3>
    <p>
      Data Analytics refers to the techniques used to analyze data to enhance
      productivity and business gain. Data is extracted from various sources and
      is cleaned and categorized to analyze various behavioral patterns

    <h3>EMBEDDED SYSTEMS</h3>
    <p>
      An embedded system is an electronic system that has a software and is
      embedded in computer hardware. It is programmable or nonprogrammable
      depending on the application. An embedded system is defined as a way of
      working, organizing, performing single or multiple tasks according to a
      set of rules.

    <h3>AUTONOMOUS ROBOTICS</h3>
    <p>
      An introduction to computational fundamentals behind the design and
      control of autonomous robots. Robots are considered to be autonomous when
      they make decisions in response to their environment (rather than simply
      following a pre-programmed set of motions). They achieve this using a
      multitude of modern techniques ranging from signal processing, control
      theory, artificial intelligence, and more.
    </p>

  <section>
    <h3>COMPUTER NETWORKING</h3>
    <p>
      Computer networking is a means by which computers are interconnected to
      share data and information, resources, and all other network devices such
      as printers.
