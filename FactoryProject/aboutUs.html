                                    Computational Math deals with the design of algorithms to perform mathematical calculations on a computer. 
                                    The goal of computational mathematics, put simply, is to find or develop algorithms that solve mathematical problems computationally.

                                Machine learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers to “self-learn” from training data and improve over time, 
                                without being explicitly programmed. 
                                Machine learning algorithms are able to detect patterns in data and learn from them, in order to make their own predictions. 
                                In short, machine learning algorithms and models learn through experience.
